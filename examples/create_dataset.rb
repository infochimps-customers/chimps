# Chimps needs a little configuring to enable authentication with
# Infochimps.  If you have a ~/.chimps file then you can make Chimps
# read it like this:
Chimps.boot!

# You could also explicitly set the minimum required configuration
# directly:
#
#   Chimps.config[:apikey]      = "YOUR API KEY"
