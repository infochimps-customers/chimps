# This is an example of the expected structure of a file used in a
# bulk update.
#
# It consists of one large array itself consisting of mappings from a
# resource name (dataset, license, source) to properties about that
# resource.
#
# Many such documents can be combined together in a YAML stream and
# sent as a single request.
